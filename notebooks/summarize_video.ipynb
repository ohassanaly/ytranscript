      "The video discusses the latest innovations in the C3 Agentic AI platform aimed at enhancing the developer experience for onboarding, building, deploying, and operating applications. Jake Whitam, who leads developer experience at C3, and Josh Prisbilo, the lead product manager, present a live demo showcasing the platform's capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key highlights include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Pre-built Applications**: The platform offers 131 pre-built AI applications that come with preconfigured data pipelines, AI models, application logic, and user interfaces, allowing for rapid deployment and scaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Developer Experience Enhancements**: The team has focused on improving the onboarding process, providing advanced training courses, integrated development tools, and real-time support through a redesigned community forum. This aims to foster self-sufficiency among developers.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **C3 AI Academy**: A revamped online learning platform with modular courses and task-based learning paths has been introduced, allowing developers to learn at their own pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Community Support**: A 24/7 engagement forum has been established for developers to ask questions and receive answers from experts, supplemented by a code assistant powered by AI to provide immediate coding support.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Data Fusion Tool**: The introduction of C3AI Studio Data Fusion allows developers to visually manage data integrations and object models, facilitating the onboarding of new data sources and real-time data integration.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Live Demo**: The presenters demonstrate the integration of live data from various sources, including Google Cloud Storage and Kafka, into a predictive maintenance application for wind turbines. They showcase how to configure data pipelines and extend the object model with new data sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Future of AI Systems**: The discussion emphasizes the importance of an omnimodal data architecture and the need for visual tools to manage and validate data effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "The session concludes with an invitation for questions and further engagement at the C3 Agentic AI booths. Overall, the innovations aim to streamline the development process and enhance collaboration among teams.\n"
