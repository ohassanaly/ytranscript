This project aims at screening the content of a YouTube channel<br>

We use Google native [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/channels/list) to retrieve all the videos titles and URLs from a given youTube channel. <br>
Nota : the channel is dentified using the the channel @handle<br>
